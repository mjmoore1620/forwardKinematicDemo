# Forward Kinematics Demo
* Based on/inspired by [Coding train video][5]

# Progress
* Started: 5/28/2020
* Milestone:
* Finished: 

# What is the purpose of this exercise?
* Demonstrate forward kinematics
* Work towards understanding and implementing inverse kinematics
    * Understanding inverse kinematics would be useful for complex animation 

# What should I get out of doing this exercise?
* I should gain a basic understanding of forward kinematics
* I should build a foundation for learning the more complex inverse kinematics algorithms

# What have I got from doing this so far?
* Trig functions review
    * How to get the x2,y2 of line with only x1,y1 + angle
* Used new git command: git reset HEAD filename
    * to unstage a file that I didn't want to be part of the commit

# Thoughts
* The mathematical and engineering formality is way overkill in the wikipedia documentation
    * [Coding math][4] made a working demo seem very simple and straight-forward
* My useful knowledge of trig is very lacking
    * Need to practice practical application

# Keywords
* kinematic chain/linkage system/linkages: a series of rigid bodies connected by joints
    * degrees of freedom/mobility: the number of independent variables that define the configuration of a kinematic chain 
        * technical jargon, not intuitive 
* end-effector: the end of the kinematic chain that interacts with the environment
* kinematic constraints: essentially going to be angle limits I think

# Issues
* I suck at trig apparently
* Need to implement 2 canvases to reproduce [Coding math part 1][4] style demo
    * Requires instance mode if using p5.js
    * Might just use base javascript

# Specifications
* On completion of forward kinematics demo, fork repo to start inverse kinematics project

# Possible Modifications
